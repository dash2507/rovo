# Rovo

## Experimental Tensor Libary in Rust inspired from Pytorch.

To-do:

- [x] Use not_ready for evaluation of function.
- [x] Impl -, /, and unary -.
- [x] Basic Linear Layer.
- [ ] function for comparing two tensors. (shallow_comapre that compares only data and shape)
- [ ] Impl OrderedDict similiar to python's.
- [ ] Pow, Exp operators.
- [ ] Improve Debug trait impls.

Corner-cases:

- [ ] RTTI for module name inference.
